# leave

## Description

So you're sitting trying to understand how you've broken the dev environment on your extra special rails project and your girlfriend calls you.

	Her: Meet you in 10 mins at the end of the road.
	You: uhuh yeah.

You go back to what you were doing and by the time ten minutes has passed you've forgotten when the call was made. You're late.
This sort of stuff happens to me all the time. I could take my phone out and set an alarm or something but this wasn't awesome
enough. 'leave' allows you to pop open a terminal and do this:

```bash
$ leave in 10
```

In ten minutes a notification pops up and tells me that its time to go. Yay! You will never need time management again.

## Installation

To install simply download the [binary](https://github.com/seadowg/leave/raw/go/leave) and copy it to somewhere that's
in your path.

*Note*: There is already a binary `/usr/bin` on OS X named 'leave'. It's similar but not as fun. To get around
this you can either alias to your leave installations binary or delete the one in ``/usr/bin`.
